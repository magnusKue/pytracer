Pytracer

In the context of a school project centered on computer graphics, 
I took on the task of creating a Python-based ray tracer. 
I chose Python because it's familiar to me and made it less intimidating 
to tackle the challenges associated with the project.

While this ray tracer may not be the fastest or most feature-packed, 
and the code is most certainly not the cleanest, 
it serves as a reflection of a structured exploration of concepts and 
an opportunity to refine my programming skills. 

The intentional use of Python, despite potential limitations, 
allowed for a focused examination of the fundamental principles of ray tracing.
Acknowledging its shortcomings, this project is a formal journey to grasp computer graphics. 
It's not about being a tech wizard; it's more about slowly figuring things out, 
proving a dedication to methodical learning in a tricky field.

In conclusion, this ray tracer serves as an academic exercise, 
showcasing the application of theoretical knowledge 
to practical implementation within the field of computer graphics.
